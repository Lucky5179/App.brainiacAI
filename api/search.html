Today, the Uniswap Protocol is the largest decentralized exchange protocol, processing over $1.5 trillion in trading volume. As public infrastructure, it's a vital part of the crypto ecosystem.\nAs technology and markets evolve, so must the Uniswap Protocol. That's why we're thrilled to introduce our vision for Uniswap v4, which we believe will open up a world of possibilities for how liquidity is created and how tokens are traded onchain.\nWe are releasing the draft code now so that v4 can be built in public, with open feedback and meaningful community contribution. We expect this will be a months-long process. You can read the open-sourced, early version of the Uniswap v4 core and periphery repositories, read the draft technical whitepaper here, and learn more about how to contribute here.\nUniswap v3 took a powerful, opinionated approach to liquidity provision, balancing an incredibly complex tradeoff space. New features come at the expense of higher fees and code complexity.  For example, v3 enshrined oracles, allowing builders to integrate real-time, onchain pricing data, but at the expense of some increased costs for swappers.\nOur vision with Uniswap v4 is to allow anyone to make these tradeoff decisions through the introduction of \"hooks.\" Hooks are contracts that run at various points of a pool action's lifecycle. Pools can make the same tradeoffs as v3, or they can add totally new functionality. For example, v4 will allow pools that natively support dynamic fees, add onchain limit orders, or act as a time-weighted average market maker (TWAMM) to spread out large orders over time.","metadata":{"description":"All about our vision for Uniswap v4 and why we're building in public.","language":"en","source":"https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-v4","title":"Our Vision for Uniswap v4 "}},{"pageContent":"Swaps | Uniswap","metadata":{"description":"Introduction","language":"en","source":"https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/protocol/swaps","title":"Swaps | Uniswap"}}],"answer":"Uniswap v4 represents a significant evolution in the Uniswap Protocol and aims to enhance how liquidity is created and tokens are traded on-chain. This new version comes in response to the need for greater flexibility and adaptability in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols as technology and market demands evolve. Below are the key elements that characterize Uniswap v4:\n\n\"\n\n### Overview\n\n- **Public Infrastructure**: Uniswap has emerged as a foundational element within the crypto ecosystem, processing over $1.5 trillion in trading volume since the release of v3 two years ago.\n\n- **Community Development**: By releasing the draft code for v4 in a public setting, Uniswap invites open feedback and encourages community contributions, making the development process collaborative. The draft code can be found [here](https://uniswap.org/docs/v4/contributing).\n\n\"\n\n### Key Features of Uniswap v4\n\n- **Hooks Mechanism**: One of the most significant innovations introduced in Uniswap v4 is the concept of \"hooks.\" Hooks are smart contracts that trigger at various stages of a pool's lifecycle, allowing developers to define custom behaviors tied to pool operations. This feature grants liquidity providers and developers more control over their liquidity management, enabling customization of strategies without modifying the core protocol.\n\n- **Dynamic Fees**: Uniswap v4 facilitates dynamic fee structures that can adapt based on the trading conditions or specific user-defined parameters. This advanced fee model supports a more responsive ecosystem, potentially enhancing profitability for liquidity providers.\n\n- **Limit Orders**: The introduction of on-chain limit orders allows users to set specific price targets for their trades. This feature increases flexibility for traders and gives them more strategic control over their transactions.\n\n- **Time-Weighted Average Market Maker (TWAMM)**: This mechanism enables traders to break up large orders into smaller trades executed over time, thereby minimizing market impact and improving trade execution prices over larger volumes.\n\n\"\n\n### Tradeoffs\n\nThe shift from v3’s opinionated approach to v4’s flexible framework includes complex tradeoffs. Uniswap v3 established fixed mechanisms regarding fees and liquidity provision, which, while powerful, contributed to higher fees and code complexity. With v4, these tradeoffs are decentralized, allowing users to customize their liquidity conditions according to their needs.\n\n\"\n\n### Ongoing Development\n\nUniswap v4’s development is ongoing, and it is expected to take several months before it is finalized. The community is encouraged to participate actively by reviewing the draft technical whitepaper found [here](https://uniswap.org/docs/v4/whitepaper) and following the progress of the core and periphery repositories.\n\n\"\n\nIn summary, Uniswap v4 aims to create a more versatile and efficient DeFi environment, paving the way for novel liquidity dynamics and trading mechanisms that align with the diversity of user requirements and market conditions. This phase of open-source development and community engagement is crucial to refining and finalizing the protocol’s capabilities."}
